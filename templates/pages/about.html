      This is a video index of Python-related video on the Internet.
      It does not <em>host</em> video&mdash;it's an index.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each video is lovingly packaged with a variety of metadata that
      comprises the context of the video: When was it taken? What was
      the venue? Who was speaking? What was the topic of the talk?
      What are the related links? Are there quality issues with the
      video?
    </p>
    <p>
      It's my hope that this metadata brings the video that's
      currently scattered about easier to find and easier to use.

        I'm working on making it easier for other people to add new
        conferences to the site so that I'm not the bottleneck, but
        that work hasn't landed, yet.

      <p>
        If you want to contribute to this site, you'll have to wait
        a bit until we get a contributor infrastructure going. I
        really want to make it easy for people to help make the
        metadata better, but the code isn't there, yet.

        I'm doing?</h3>
      <p>
        I've spent a lot of time over the last few years building what
        you see here. It may not look like much, but it's done entirely
        in my spare time and it's a labor of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Donate to the tip jar and show me how much a resource like this means
        to you.

      <h3>How is this site put together?</h3>
      <p>
        The software that runs this site is called richard. It's a free
        software project. You can find the code on GitHub at
        <a href="http://github.com/willkg/richard">http://github.com/willkg/richard</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The software that I use to work on the metadata and add it to
        pyvideo.org is called steve. It's also a free software project.
        You can find the code on GitHub at
        <a href="http://github.com/willkg/steve">http://github.com/willkg/steve</a>.

      <h3>Future plans</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Done!: Better feed support
        <li>Done!: Read-only API
        <li>Better subtitling support whether that's through Universal
          Subtitles or something else
        <li>Better metadata
        <li>Better browsing interface
        <li>Better search interface
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of these are being worked on in the underlying
        software. See <a href="https://github.com/willkg/richard/issues">richard
        issue tracker</a> for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the data in pyvideo.org is ok, but could be a lot
        better. I'm working on improving that, making it easier for
        other people to improve it, and adding additional conferences to
        the index.
