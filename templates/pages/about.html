    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>
      This is a video index of Python-related video on the Internet.
      It does not <em>host</em> video&mdash;it's an index.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each video is lovingly packaged with a variety of metadata that
      comprises the context of the video: When was it taken? What was the
      venue? Who was speaking? What was the topic of the talk?  What are the
      related links? Are there quality issues with the video?
    </p>
    <p>
      It's my hope that this metadata brings the video that's currently
      scattered about easier to find and easier to use.
    </p>

          If you want to contribute to this site, you'll have to wait a bit until
          we get a contributor infrastructure going. I really want to make it easy
          for people to help make the metadata better, but the code isn't there,
          yet.

    <h2>How's it put together?</h2>
    <p>
      The software that runs this site is called richard. It's a free
      software project. You can find the code on GitHub at
      <a href="http://github.com/willkg/richard">http://github.com/willkg/richard</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Thank you!</h2>
    <p>
      I want to thank:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://github.com/willkg/richard/blob/master/AUTHORS">richard
        development team</a> for building the software that runs this site

      <li><a href="http://pculture.org/">Participatory Culture Foundation</a>
        for putting together
        <a href="http://mirocommunity.org/">Miro Community</a> which got me
        started curating Python video

      <li>Carl and Ryan at <a href="http://nextdayvideo.com/">Next Day Video</a>
        and the video teams that have filmed a large majority of this video
        over the years&mdash;the work they do is magical and they're great
        to work with

      <li><a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>
        for the grant they awarded me in 2011 that paid costs I was accruing
        with Python Miro Community and for being so supportive of my efforts
        like they are with the many others who volunteer for Python community
        things

      <li><a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> for hiring me and bringing
        me back to web development and also building a lot of the libraries I 
        used on the site

      <li>the people who put together these conferences&mdash;it's a metric
        ton of work that goes into bringing so many people together under one
        roof to be together, learn, and share
    </ul>
