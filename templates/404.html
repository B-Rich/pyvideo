<p>
  Gah! Somehow you ended up on a page that's not handled
  anywhere. I really apologize for this.
</p>

<h1>What happens now?</h1>
<p>
  I don't watch for 404 errors, so the best thing for you to
  do is fire off an email to me at <em>willg at bluesock dot org</em>
  with the url you're trying to go to and any information you
  think is relevant to how you got there.
</p>
<p>
  I'll respond within a week. I'll probably either fix it immediately
  or write up a bug report and fix it later.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, <a href="http://pyvideo.org/">you can go back to the home page</a>.
