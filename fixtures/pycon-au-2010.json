In this talk we see how Python was introduced to a Java shop as a vehicle for rapid and dynamic prototyping of a new project. The talk then explains how Jython/Java integration was used to translate this project step by step from Python to Java. Going beyond the advocacy focus, the talk then shows the interfaces to call Java from Python and vice versa and illustrates those with examples. Furthermore, unit testing of Java classes via test cases written in Python is also touched upon.\n</p>",

However, by looking at the successes and challenges faced by other CMSes and collections of apps such as Pinax, we have taken the philosophy a stage futher. \n </p>\n<p>\nRather than being a collection of Django apps, we have constructed GLAMkit as a collection of optional and reusable Django 'toolkits' for implementing common features. We leave the implementation details - the things that Django already does brilliantly - to the application developers themselves. \n </p>\n<p>\nIn this talk, we will present the history of GLAMkit's development, with particular focus on how our approach to reusability came about, and some examples of that approach.\n</p>",

This talk will take a couple of those local real-world datasets and create a minimal website for remixing them, using Django as the underlying framework. The goals are to provide a short walk through the process of importing and extracting such data in practice, show how to incorporate Django's GIS features into an application, as well as highlighting that real world is messy and so is the data it produces. Working with datasets for journalism or research purposes, or simply fun, requires a certain attention to detail. \n</p>\n<p> \nBasic knowledge of Django is assumed, although the GIS components will be introduced carefully as they are less familiar to many developers.\n</p>",

Many differences and advantages between this framework and traditional python application frameworks are explained. Genropy is a suitable for creating complex 'applications' as opposed to 'sites'. The differentiation is that an application is something an operator uses all day, has trained users, that have to 'squeeze' all the power from it available. Conversely, a 'site' is basically public and not necessarily powerful as a user spends a relatively small amount of time on it. Genropy is the framework for creation applications. It is used for attendee registration and sales in pycon italy, the larger national conference in Europe (Florence, Italy). \n</p>\n<p>\nThis session will demonstrate how to create a simple application (3 tables) and demonstrate the ease and power of using python for the model view and controller on the client. It demonstrates how one api- being the genro Bag - is used to create the model, to map the sql to objects, to create the GUI and communicate all data. So all of it can be done in python instead of having to use many different technologies and languages. \n</p>\n<p>\nJeff Edwards from Goodsoftware is strategic partner of Sofwell who is the author of Genropy.\n</p>",
