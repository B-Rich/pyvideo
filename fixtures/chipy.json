      "description": "A common complaint about Django, the leading Python web application framework, is that it doesn't make writing REST APIs easy enough. In fact the paradigm for a typical Django application involves views which map to HTML page templates. With end users increasingly expecting rich interfaces with the responsiveness of a desktop application, this paradigm is being superseded. Fortunately a third-party Django application called Piston fills the gap. Django/Piston can be combined with the Ext JS JavaScript framework and widget set to create attractive, responsive Web applications, and this talk will show you how.\n<p>\n ChiPy is a group of Chicago Python Programmers, l33t, and n00bs.

So that's pretty interesting on its own. But there's plenty more interesting stuff to discuss. It's going to be mostly an overview talk. Blender's python integration could possibly span 3 separate talks, especially considering the blender game engine's use of it, which is a separate but interesting talk.\"\n</p><p>\nChiPy is a group of Chicago Python Programmers, l33t, and n00bs. Meetings are held monthly at various locations around Chicago. Also, ChiPy is a proud sponsor of many Open Source and Educational efforts in Chicago.
