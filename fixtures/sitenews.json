It's still not great, but this is a pretty new piece of software.</p><p>I've talked with Carl and Ryan with the video team and I'm working on the code for getting PyCon US 2012 videos posted here. Pretty sure I'll have it done in the next 12 hours.</p><p>One interesting thing is that this year, the videos are getting posted to YouTube. In previous years, they were posted to blip.tv.</p><p>I'll have more status soon!</p>",

There are things I want to do that are difficult with the <a href=\"http://mirocommunity.org/\">Miro Community</a> service, so I created <a href=\"http://github.com/willkg/richard\">richard</a>. This site uses richard and replaces Python Miro Community.</p>",
            "content": "<p>richard is pretty new---I started working on it in February 2012. I just pushed the code to github and threw together the pyvideo.org site in time for PyCon US 2012. As such, it's got a lot of rough edges. I'll be working on those going forward.</p>\n<p>\"Why richard?\", you might ask. Well, the gist of it is that I wanted better Universal Subtitles support, I wanted to make it easier for Carl to experiment with other ways of putting together post-conference video, and I wanted to make it <em>way</em> easier to put new conferences on the site and for other people to help out. Miro Community really sucks for both of those in the way I want to do them.</p>\n<p>Basically, richard removes a lot of the roadblocks that made running Python Miro Community difficult, time consuming, and prevented me from making the site what I want to make it. However, richard is currently a hodge-podge of shortcuts, so at the moment, I'm just trading one set of problems for another. Hopefully, this decision will pan out in the near term.</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be fixing data on the site because it currently kind of sucks. Then I'll be working on making it easier to \"crowdsource\" metadata fixing.</p>\n<p>That's enough ramble for now. Long live pyvideo.org!</p>",
