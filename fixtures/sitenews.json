There are things I want to do that are difficult with the <a href=\"http://mirocommunity.org/\">Miro Community</a> service, so I created <a href=\"http://github.com/willkg/richard\">richard</a>. This site uses richard and replaces Python Miro Community.</p>",
      "content": "<p>richard is pretty new---I started working on it in February 2012. I just pushed the code to github and threw together the pyvideo.org site in time for PyCon US 2012. As such, it's got a lot of rough edges. I'll be working on those going forward.</p>\n<p>\"Why richard?\", you might ask. Well, the gist of it is that I wanted better Universal Subtitles support, I wanted to make it easier for Carl to experiment with other ways of putting together post-conference video, and I wanted to make it <em>way</em> easier to put new conferences on the site and for other people to help out. Miro Community really sucks for both of those in the way I want to do them.</p>\n<p>Basically, richard removes a lot of the roadblocks that made running Python Miro Community difficult, time consuming, and prevented me from making the site what I want to make it. However, richard is currently a hodge-podge of shortcuts, so at the moment, I'm just trading one set of problems for another. Hopefully, this decision will pan out in the near term.</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be fixing data on the site because it currently kind of sucks. Then I'll be working on making it easier to \"crowdsource\" metadata fixing.</p>\n<p>That's enough ramble for now. Long live pyvideo.org!</p>",
