How to log effectively so it makes sense later, and what sorts of things we should be instrumenting and measuring.\n</li><li>how to set up a remote console session into our running application, so we can interrogate variables and run code to figure out what's going on.\n</li><li>how to incorporate IRC or IM bots so we can interact with our apps from the desktop, and how they can interact with us. \n</li></ul>\n<p>\n     [VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.

      "description": "<p>pyserf - a shortcut for writing C extensions in C</p>\n<p>Presented by Douglas Bagnall</p>\n<p>Abstract</p>\n<p>\n    There are many clever ways of connecting Python and C code together, and pyserf is one of those. It is just a short script that parses a module outline and produces an idiomatic template for a C extension providing the same signatures, so all you need to do is write the bits that actually do stuff.\n</p>\n<p>Outline</p>\n<p>\n    Pyserf is a tiny project that I wrote for my own use years ago and never released because it is so obvious that dozens of better versions must exist. The idea is simple -- you write an outline of a module like this:\n</p>\n<pre>\n\"\"\"module documentation\"\"\"\ndef top_level_function(int_a, float_b):\n   \"function documentation\"\n   return float_c\n\nclass SomeModule:\n   \"\"\"class documentation\"\"\"\n   def foo(self, int_ants obj_zoo):\n      \"\"\"method documentation\"\"\"\n      return float_frogs\n</pre>\n<p>\nand pyserf uses the parsing modules in the standard library to generate a C file that will compile to an extension providing the interface it describes, with the documentation appearing in the right place and the type conversions all properly handled. The generated file is not a hideous unreadable mess, rather it is within a few characters of best practise according to the official tutorial. Once you have this template, you abandon your outline and write the middles of each function in C. In describing what pyserf does, this talk will demonstrate what is required to write an extension in C by hand, and show you some ways of using the standard libraries parsing modules.\n</p>\n<p>\n     [VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.

This talk describes how. \n</p>\n<p>Outline</p>\n<p>\n    Te Tuhi Video Game System is not a game in itself; rather it creates games based on arbitrary images that it is given. To use it, you draw a picture of the game you want to play, and it will give you the game that you really drew. The software was originally written for an art exhibit using slightly specialised hardware, but it has been released under the GPL and runs on ordinary computers. It uses Pygame, PIL, and custom C extensions that allow it to evolve a playable game from a wide variety of pictures. This talk will discuss the techniques used (both refined algorithms and hacky heuristics) and cover topics such as image analysis, machine learning, and interface design. There will be a demonstration. \n</p>\n<p>\n     [VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n</p>",

I will aim to show what is possible with current libraries, demonstrate their usability, explore their limitations, and cover elements of best coding practice. Firstly, I will briefly present the basics, such as video grabbing, image processing and computer vision algorithms. I will illustrate my presentation with the Python bindings to the opencv library and show different examples such as displaying a video image, some filtering algorithms (dilation, gaussian blur), and how to implement facial recognition. I will describe after how related tasks can be achieved with other Python tools such as scipy and pygame. I will show how these three libraries can be used in conjunction to perform video capturing, image processing and user interfacing. Finally, I will introduce my basic Python computer vision framework, which is aimed at inexperienced users, and demonstrate it on the XO laptop, the inexpensive low-powered sub-notebook distributed as part of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative.\n</p>\n<p>\n     [VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.

Tools, techniques, and tips.\n</p>\n<p>Outline</p>\n<p>\n    Life would be so much easier if the data contained in websites was available raw via APIs. Alas, until that mythical day comes we either need to deal with unhelpful people via email and phone, or just get it ourselves. Python has some great tools available to help with building scrapers and for parsing and formatting the data we get. Starting off with the basics - tracking what needs to be done, making web requests, parsing HTML, following links, and extricating data from Excel and PDF documents. Our scraper needs to be resilient against too-clever content management systems, Frontpage-era HTML, and plain dodgy data. We may need to pass through logins and other messiness. There are some techniques and tips for approaching the problems and keeping your solution flexible and as simple as possible. We'll discuss some scrapers built for New Zealand data, and introduce a new project from the NZ open government data group to provide a RESTful interface to scrapers - effectively creating a nice API where there isn't one. \n</p>\n<p>Slides: <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/rcoup/me-wants-it-scraping-sites-to-get-data\">http://www.slideshare.net/rcoup/me-wants-it-scraping-sites-to-get-data</a></p>\n<p>\n     [VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.

The speaker, a noted Plone author and consultant, will demonstrate the featureset of Plone, and provide real-world hints on the customer value and challenges it provides.\n</p>\n<p>Outline</p>\n<p>\nHere, you can learn where Plone may serve your needs well, and where it might be overkill or inappropriately deployed. You'll also learn approximate budgets, in time and learning, you'd need to get up to speed on the system. In addition, a demonstration of the upcoming features of Plone 4 and a future-looking glance at the radically-redesigned Plone 5 will be given. Recommended for new and casual users of Plone, and for people interested in understanding its niche in the CMS/application development world.\n</p>\n<p>\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.

Along the way you'll see various features of the test framework 'nose' in action and even some doctests.
